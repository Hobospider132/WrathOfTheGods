# Details
Last year, I had a repo called "Square1" (Now deleted) which had a malaware that I developed, It did not run correctly last year, I didn't write the code correctly, this year, I've rewritten my code. I would like to state that this code is for educational purposes to show how trojans can be developed and how ntdll can be used to grant privileges. As always, don't use this code for malicious purposees, this is purely to educate.
